# Mapping_Earthquakes
This project demonstrated my knowledge of JavaScript using GeoJSON data files of earthquakes around the world, then using Leaflet to apply that data to a map with multiple layers to visualize that data. I made several different branches to attack the problem piece by piece and add different layers, styling, and legends to my map. The different mapbox styles I used change the map layers to show the magnitude of each earthquake using different radii of circles and even the tectonic plates to show the correlation between tectonic plates and greater magnitude of earthquakes around the globe. These layers can be toggled on or off to visualize the data for the user to create a very quick and interactive way of finding out trends and imbue knowledge fast and effectively.
